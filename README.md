# Gulp Base

A base for projects using Gulp. Pulls in a [public base](https://github.com/rthor/public-base) for `/src` which in turn bases it's SCSS on my [Pretty SCSS](https://github.com/rthor/pretty-scss) base. 

## Usage

| Dev. server     | Production build |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| `$ gulp server` | `$ gulp --prod` |
