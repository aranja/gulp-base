## Usage

Getting started is done in a few steps.

### 1. Clone the Repo:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/aranja/gulp-base.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```sh
$ [sudo] npm i

The server can always be booted up by the `gulp server` and for a production build, simply pass the flag `--prod`.

*Note: When a server is not a necessity, just run `gulp --prod` to build a production ready version of the app.*
